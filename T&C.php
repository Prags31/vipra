<h2> Operating Agreement</h2>
<p>
	This Agreement contains the complete terms and conditions that apply to an individual's or entity's participation in the Vipra Fashion Affiliate Program (the "<strong>Program</strong>"). As used in this Agreement, "<strong>we</strong>", "<strong>us</strong>", or "<strong>our</strong>" means Vipra Fashion Internet Private Limited or any of our affiliate; parent; or group companies and our successors and assigns, as the case may be, and "<strong>you</strong>" means the applicant. <strong>Vipra Fashion Site</strong> means, collectively, the Vipra Fashion.com website, the Vipra Fashion mobile website and the Vipra Fashion mobile applications. "<strong>Your site</strong>" means your website where you will link to the Vipra Fashion Site (and which you will identify in your Program application). Save for our obligation to pay referral fees under Section 4, which may be performed solely by us, we may cause any of our obligations under this Agreement to be fulfilled by any of our Affiliates (defined below), on our behalf.

                </ul>

                <p>
                    If we determine that you have not complied with any requirement or restriction provided in the Program or any other applicable policies or that you have otherwise violated this Agreement, we may (in addition to any other rights or remedies available to us) withhold any fees payable to you under this Agreement, terminate this Agreement, or both. In addition, you hereby consent to us monitoring, recording, using, and disclosing information about your site and visitors to your site that we obtain in connection with your display of Special Links, and monitoring, crawling, and otherwise investigating your site to verify compliance with this Agreement and Program.
                </p>

                <br />
                <p><b>Self Orders / Bulk Orders</b></p>

                <p>
                    Please also note that you may not purchase products during sessions initiated through the links on your site for your own use, for resale or commercial use of any kind. This includes orders for customers or on behalf of customers or orders for products to be used by you or your friends, relatives, or associates in any manner. The reason behind this policy is that the Vipra Fashion Affiliate Program is an advertising program rather than a discount program. Our goal is to have our affiliates refer new customers to us in return for referral fees. Affiliates are not eligible for referral fees when they place orders themselves, or ask people they know to routinely place orders through their affiliate links so they can earn referral fees. If you are found in violation of these policies, then Vipra Fashion has the right to terminate your registration, as well as revoke all payments linked to your account, unless you can show that the purchases were genuine.
                </p>


                <p><b>Paid Search Ads campaigns</b></p>

                <p>
                    For Paid Search Ads through Google AdWords campaigns or of other search engines, Affiliates cannot send users directly to the Vipra Fashion Site through keyword bidding or other paid search activities. However, if your Paid Search Ads, without using any Vipra Fashion trademarks or variations and misspelling of such trademarks, send users to your own website and then your website displays affiliate links to Vipra Fashion Site, you may earn referral fees for eligible purchases made by users who click through your Paid Search Ads to your website and then click through to the Vipra Fashion Site. You shall not include Vipra Fashion domain name (www.Vipra Fashion.com) as Display URL or Destination / Landing Page URL in the ad copies of your AdWords campaigns. Any affiliate found / identified by us (we have systems in place to identify) directing users / traffic to Vipra Fashion Site directly through Paid Search Ads will be penalised. Non-compliance would not only lead to suspension of your affiliate account, but also cancellation of all pending commissions and commissions thereafter.
                </p>


                <p><b>Paid Install (CPI) campaigns for Vipra Fashion Mobile App(s)</b></p>

                <p>With respect to our Mobile App install campaigns through Vipra Fashion Affiliate Program, we do a rigorous data check using industry standard parameters for checking the authenticity &amp; quality of app installs through your Affiliate id to keep a check on fraudulent / low quality app installs happening through unethical means. Please note that we hold the right to check the quality of installs being served by our Affiliates and the right to suspend/disable their Affiliate account or withhold payments if we observe any fraudulent stuff happening through your Affiliate id. Under such circumstances we hold the right to terminate/disable your affiliate account and/or withhold all pending affiliate commissions with immediate effect without any prior notice.</p>

                <p>By participating in the Program you agree that you will not engage in any such activities. If we reject your application, you are welcome to reapply to the Program at any time. You should also note that if we accept your application and your site is thereafter determined (in our sole discretion) to be unsuitable for the Program at a later period, we may terminate this Agreement with immediate effect including withholding all your pending commission payments, with or without notice, as may be determined in sole discretion of Vipra Fashion.com.</p>

                <p>We record the traffic sent by you to Vipra Fashion Site in our logs and hold the authority to withhold your payments/disable your account in case of:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Self orders or bulk orders;</li>
                    <li>Prohibited paid install campaigns for Vipra Fashion Mobile App;</li>
                    <li>Prohibited Paid Search Ads campaigns; or</li>
                    <li>Links to the Vipra Fashion Site, including a redirecting link, that is generated or displayed on a search engine in response to a general internet search query or keyword (i.e., in natural, free, organic, or unpaid search results), whether those links appear through your submission of data to that site or otherwise.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Further, by participating in the Program you agree that you have read and understood the contents of Vipra Fashion Terms of Use (<a href="://www.Vipra Fashion.com/s/term">http://www.Vipra Fashion.com/s/terms</a>) and contents of the said Terms of Use shall be read as part and parcel of the Agreement, wherever applicable and be binding upon you.
